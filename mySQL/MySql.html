<!-- RDBMS,SQL -->
<!-- MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate databases. It is widely used for web applications, enterprise applications, and data-driven systems.

Key Features of MySQL
Scalability – Handles large databases efficiently.
High Performance – Optimized for speed and reliability.
Security – Provides authentication, encryption, and access control.
Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Open-Source – Free to use, with enterprise editions available. -->

<!-- datatypes : (INT,VAR,VARCHAR,TEXT,DATE) -->

<!-- 1. Numeric Data Types -->
<!-- 2. String (Character) Data Types -->
<!-- 3. Date and Time Data Types -->

<!-- CONTRAINTS(rules) -->
<!-- primary key, foreign key , unique,notnull , check -->

<!-- Constraints are rules applied to table columns to ensure data integrity and consistency. -->
<!-- 1. PRIMARY KEY
Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Cannot contain NULL values. -->

<!-- 2. FOREIGN KEY
Enforces a relationship between two tables.
Ensures referential integrity. -->

<!-- 3. UNIQUE
Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
 -->

<!-- 4. NOT NULL
Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values. -->

<!-- 5. CHECK
Restricts the values that can be inserted. -->

<!-- 6. DEFAULT
Sets a default value if no value is provided. -->

<!-- 
1: MySQL is a powerful relational database system that supports structured data storage.
2: Data Types help define the type of data a column can store.
3: Constraints ensure data integrity and accuracy in tables. 
-->

<!-- CRUD(CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE) -->
<!-- INSERT INTO  -->
<!-- SELECT * FROM -->
<!-- UPDATE  table  SET kya update krna hai -->
<!-- DELETE FROM (delete,drop)-->
<!-- delete(tables head format is still on db) -->
<!-- drop(table with head format is deleted) -->

<!-- FILTERING DATA(WHERE,LIKE,IN,BETWEEN) -->

<!-- WHERE: Filters records based on a condition.


LIKE: Searches for a specified pattern in a column.
The LIKE operator is used for pattern matching in text values.

% → Represents zero or more characters.
_ → Represents a single character.


IN: Specifies multiple values for a column.
BETWEEN: Filters records within a range. -->

<!-- Sorting data(ORDER BY,LIMIT,OFFSET) -->

<!-- ORDER BY: Sorts records in ascending or descending order.
LIMIT: Limits the number of records returned.
OFFSET: Skips a specified number of records. -->

<!-- The ORDER BY clause is used to sort query results in either:

2️1 Ascending order (ASC) → Default
Descending order (DESC) -->

<!-- 2 LIMIT Clause
The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned.

Example: Get the top 3 highest-paid employees -->

<!-- Agregate functions: (*count,sum,avg,min,max,groupby,having) -->
<!-- 1️⃣ COUNT() - Count the Number of Rows
Counts the total number of records. -->
<!-- 2️⃣ SUM() - Calculate the Total Value
Calculates the total sum of a column. -->
<!-- 
3️⃣ AVG() - Calculate the Average Value
Calculates the average value of a numeric column. -->
<!-- 4️⃣ MIN() & MAX() - Find Minimum and Maximum Values
Finds the smallest (MIN) and largest (MAX) values in a column. -->
<!-- 5️⃣ GROUP BY - Grouping Data
The GROUP BY clause groups rows with the same values in a column and applies aggregate functions. -->
<!-- 6️⃣ HAVING - Filtering Groups
The HAVING clause filters grouped records after aggregation (similar to WHERE but used with GROUP BY). -->
