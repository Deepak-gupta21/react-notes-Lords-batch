<!-- Introduction to react -->
<!-- advantages of react -->

<!-- React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta).
  It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state efficiently. 
  React follows a component-based architecture and uses a virtual DOM for optimized rendering.

  react (javascript librarey)
  it uses virtual dom technology
  and components based artictecture

  html , css and js 

Advantages of React
Component-Based Architecture – Breaks UI into reusable components for better maintainability.
Virtual DOM – Improves performance by updating only changed parts of the UI.
One-Way Data Binding – Ensures predictable data flow, making debugging easier.
Reusable Components – Saves time by using pre-built components across the application.
Strong Community Support – Backed by Meta and a large developer community.
SEO-Friendly – Faster rendering improves SEO compared to traditional JavaScript frameworks.
Easy to Learn – Uses JSX, which is similar to HTML, making it accessible for beginners.
Rich Ecosystem – Supports state management libraries like Redux, Context API, and integrations with various tools. -->

<!-- Difference Between Virtual DOM and Real DOM
Feature	Virtual DOM	Real DOM
Definition	A lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to improve performance.	The actual structure of HTML elements rendered in the browser.
Update Speed	Faster because it updates only the changed parts.	Slower because it updates the entire UI.
Efficiency	Uses diffing algorithm to find changes and update only necessary parts.	Updates all elements even if only one part of the UI changes.
Performance	High performance due to minimal direct manipulation of the DOM.	Slower performance as changes directly affect the UI.
Re-rendering	Updates only the components that have changed.	Redraws the entire UI for any change.
Memory Usage	Efficient, as React keeps a lightweight virtual representation.	Can consume more memory and processing power. -->

<!-- functional component / class component -->

<!-- When to Use Functional vs. Class Components?
✅ Use Functional Components (Recommended):

When writing new React applications.
If you need state or side effects, use Hooks.
When you want cleaner, more modern, and maintainable code.
❌ Use Class Components (Only if required):

When working with older React projects.
If you need to use lifecycle methods without refactoring to Hooks. -->
<!-- how react is rendering the ui  -->
<!-- what is props , how to pass that -->
<!-- props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. 
 They are read-only and cannot be modified inside the child component. -->

<!-- state management ans what is state -->

<!-- State is a built-in object in React that stores data within a 
 component and causes re-renders when updated. -->

<!-- react rerender , state variable changes , props from pareent is changed, when parent is rerendered! -->

<!-- handling events in react -->

<!-- Event Type	Example -->
<!-- Click	<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
Form Submit	<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>
Input Change	<input onChange={handleChange} />
Mouse Hover	<div onMouseEnter={handleHover}>Hover</div>
Key Press	<input onKeyDown={handleKeyPress} />
Prevent Default	event.preventDefault()
Stop Propagation	event.stopPropagation() -->

<!-- what are hooks -->
<!-- useState() -->
<!-- useEffect() -->
<!-- useRef()-->
<!-- useMemo() -->
<!-- useCallback -->

<!-- condinal operation -->
<!-- 
Your components will often need to display different things depending on
different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using
JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators. -->

<!-- how to work with map() -->

<!-- what are keys in list -->
<!-- Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can
match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g.
due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React
infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree. -->

<!-- pure/impure components, why we need that -->

<!-- pure: doesnt modify external variable / object,for the same input same output  -->

<!-- every react compoent should be build pure , so that we can use it any where and make it resulable -->

<!-- controlled and un controlled components -->

<!-- A controlled component is a component where React controls
  the form element’s value using useState. -->

<!-- An uncontrolled component lets the DOM handle the form element’s 
   state using useRef instead of useState. -->

<!-- props drilling -->

<!-- context api (global state managemnt) -->

<!-- Problems with Props Drilling , Solutions to Avoid Props Drilling -->
<!-- If the data is only passed down one or two levels, props drilling is fine. But
if multiple levels are involved, Context API or state management solutions are
better. -->

<!-- react router -->

<!-- React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It
enables you to define multiple pages/views and switch between them without a
full page reload. -->
