<!-- Introduction to backend/node js  -->

<!-- The backend is the server-side of a web application that handles logic, database interactions, authentication, and communication with the frontend. It plays a crucial role in:
 
Storing and retrieving data from databases.
Managing user authentication and authorization.
Handling business logic and processing requests.
Communicating with third-party services (APIs, payment gateways, etc.).
Serving data to the frontend using APIs (REST, GraphQL, etc.).-->

<!-- /Introduction to Node.js
What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. It enables asynchronous, event-driven programming, making it lightweight and efficient.

Why use Node.js in MERN?
In the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Node.js plays a vital role as the backend technology because:

Same language (JavaScript) for frontend and backend.
Fast execution due to the V8 engine.
Handles multiple connections efficiently using an event-driven, non-blocking model.
Large ecosystem with npm (Node Package Manager). -->

<!-- advantages of node js -->
<!-- Advantages of Node.js
✅ Asynchronous & Non-blocking – Handles multiple requests efficiently.
✅ Fast Execution – Built on Chrome's high-performance V8 engine.
✅ Single Programming Language – JavaScript for both frontend & backend.
✅ Scalability – Suitable for microservices and real-time applications.

<!-- npm  -->

<!-- What is npm?
npm (Node Package Manager) is used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages (libraries).

What is package.json?
It is a configuration file that stores metadata about a Node.js project, including dependencies and scripts.

Creating package.json
sh
Copy
Edit
npm init -y -->

<!-- creating simple node js script -->

<!-- package.json , npm scripts -->
<!-- common reqire , export E6  -->
<!-- basic node build in modules -->
<!-- Acynronous operation (callback , promises,acync -await) -->
<!-- http module a simple server -->

<!-- 
The backend handles data, logic, authentication, and APIs.
Node.js is a powerful runtime for server-side JavaScript.
npm manages dependencies, and package.json stores project metadata.
Built-in modules like fs, path, and os help interact with files and the OS.
Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await) optimizes performance.
The http module helps create simple web servers. -->

<!-- REST (Representaioonal state transfer apies) -->


<!-- A REST API (Representational State Transfer 
Application Programming Interface) is a web service that allows different
 applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.
  It follows REST architecture principles to provide a structured and scalable way to interact with 
  web services. -->



<!-- Key Features of REST API -->


<!-- ✅ Stateless – Each request from a client contains all necessary information, and the server does not store any client context.
✅ Uses Standard HTTP Methods – REST APIs work with standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
✅ Uses JSON or XML – Data is typically exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is lightweight and easy to read.
✅ Resource-Based – Everything in REST is treated as a resource (e.g., users, products, orders).
✅ Separation of Client and Server – The frontend and backend remain independent. -->




 <!-- HTTP Methods in REST API -->


<!-- HTTP Method	Description	Example
GET	Retrieve data	GET /users (Fetch all users)
POST	Create new data	POST /users (Create a new user)
PUT	Update existing data	PUT /users/1 (Update user with ID 1)
DELETE	Remove data	DELETE /users/1 (Delete user with ID 1) -->


<!-- Conclusion -->
 
<!-- REST API allows communication between different systems using HTTP methods.
Node.js & Express make it easy to create RESTful APIs.
JSON format is widely used for data exchange.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) can be implemented with simple routes. -->
